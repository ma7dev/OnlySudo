## Setup
### `.env` file setup

The content of the `.env` would be the following:

```.env
# development
PORT=5000
BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000

# General
PREFIX=!

# Discord bot
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=XXX
DISCORD_TOKEN=XXX
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=XXX

# Twitch bot
TWITCH_ACCESS_TOKEN=XXX
TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=XXX
TWITCH_BOT_USERNAME=XXX
```

Instructions to get the required values:
- `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` and `DISCORD_TOKEN`:
  -  Access [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) then create a `New Application` if you don't have a bot already
  -  Click on the bot
     -  Select `OAuth2` then copy `CLIENT ID` (this is for `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`)
     -  Select Bot then copy `TOKEN` (this is for `DISCORD_TOKEN`)
- `DISCORD_GUILD_ID`: Follow [this link](https://www.remote.tools/remote-work/how-to-find-discord-id#how-to) to setup `Developer Mode` and to get your server's ID (aka `DISCORD_GUILD_ID`)
- `TWITCH_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `TWITCH_CLIENT_ID`: Follow [this link](https://twitchtokengenerator.com/)
- `TWITCH_BOT_USERNAME`: This is your bot's twitch username (lower cased)

If you want the images to be accessed externally, use [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/) and replace `BASE_URL` value in `src/index.js` with the new url.
